## 1. TL;DR

- **Build tool:** `electron-builder` (config in [`electron-builder.yml`](../electron-builder.yml)).
- **Auto-update:** `electron-updater` (`^6.8.9`), wired in [`electron/main/updater.ts`](../electron/main/updater.ts).
- **Host + update feed:** **GitHub Releases** (free, CDN, 2 GB/file, no egress cost). **No R2/S3 needed** at this scale — that's a later optimization, a 4-line config swap if bandwidth ever becomes a cost problem.
- **Per-OS behavior:** Windows & Linux update **silently** (download in background → install on quit). macOS shows a **"Download" banner** (unsigned mac can't self-install).
- **Releases are built by CI**, one runner per OS, triggered by pushing a `v*` git tag.
- **You cannot build a mac/linux installer on Windows** — each OS is built on its own CI runner.

## 2. Architecture

```
Developer bumps version + pushes tag  v0.1.3
        │
        ▼
GitHub Actions (.github/workflows/release.yml)   ← matrix: win / mac / linux
        │  each runner: npm ci → build React → build Electron → electron-builder --publish always
        ▼
GitHub Release  v0.1.3
        ├─ Photo Editor Setup 0.1.3.exe      + latest.yml         (Windows)
        ├─ Photo Editor-0.1.3.dmg            + latest-mac.yml     (macOS)
        ├─ Photo Editor-0.1.3.AppImage       + latest-linux.yml   (Linux)
        └─ *.blockmap                         (delta-update maps)
        │
        ▼
Installed apps (electron-updater on launch + every 6h)
        ├─ Win/Linux: read latest*.yml → download in background → install on quit (SILENT)
        └─ macOS:     GitHub API version check → "Download" banner → user installs DMG manually
```

## 3. Current wiring (what's in the repo)

| Concern | File | State |
|---|---|---|
| Installer config | [`electron-builder.yml`](../electron-builder.yml) | win=nsis, mac=dmg, linux=AppImage; `publish: github` |
| Updater logic | [`electron/main/updater.ts`](../electron/main/updater.ts) | per-OS split; **called** from index.ts |
| Updater invocation | [`electron/main/index.ts`](../electron/main/index.ts) | `initAutoUpdater()` live (guarded by `app.isPackaged`) |
| Mac banner UI | [`src/components/UpdateBanner.jsx`](../src/components/UpdateBanner.jsx) | mounted in `src/layout/index.jsx` |
| Mac entitlements | [`build-resources/entitlements.mac.plist`](../build-resources/entitlements.mac.plist) | JIT entitlements for hardened runtime |
| CI | [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](../.github/workflows/release.yml) | 3-OS matrix, tag-triggered |

**Key constants** (in `updater.ts`): re-check every **6h** (`CHECK_INTERVAL_MS`), mac first check after **15s** (`MAC_FIRST_CHECK_DELAY_MS` — lets the renderer's listener mount before the fire-and-forget push).

**App identity:** `appId: com.printpoz.photoeditor`, `productName: "Photo Editor"`, output dir `release/`.

---

## 4. Per-OS auto-update strategy (and why)

The behavior is identical code (`download → install on quit`) branching only on `process.platform`:

### Windows / Linux — fully silent
`electron-updater` with `autoDownload=true` + `autoInstallOnAppQuit=true`. No prompt, no button. Reads `latest.yml` / `latest-linux.yml` from the GitHub Release, downloads in the background, installs when the user next quits. This is the Slack/VS Code model. **Works even unsigned** (Windows shows a SmartScreen warning on first *install* only, not on updates).

### macOS — notify-only banner
An **unsigned** mac app **cannot self-install** an update — Squirrel.Mac rejects an unsigned bundle. So on mac we skip Squirrel entirely:
1. `updater.ts` → `initMacNotifyOnly()` does a lightweight GitHub "latest release" API version check.
2. If newer, it pushes `"available"` over the existing `update:status` IPC channel.
3. `UpdateBanner.jsx` shows a banner with a **Download** button → `openExternal` to the releases page.
4. User downloads the new `.dmg` and installs it manually.

**When you get an Apple Developer cert:** delete `initMacNotifyOnly` + the banner and let macOS fall through to `initSilentAutoUpdater` like the others — then mac updates silently too.

## 5. Code signing status

**Currently: nothing is signed.** Implications:

| OS | Unsigned consequence | To fix |
|---|---|---|
| **Windows** | SmartScreen "Windows protected your PC" on first install (More info → Run anyway). Auto-update still works. | Code-signing cert (~$200–400/yr, Sectigo/DigiCert). EV cert clears SmartScreen instantly. |
| **macOS** | Gatekeeper blocks first launch ("unidentified developer" → right-click Open). **Auto-update impossible.** | Apple Developer Program ($99/yr) → Developer ID cert → sign + **notarize**. |
| **Linux** | None. AppImage runs unsigned. | n/a |

**How signing plugs in (already stubbed):**
- Windows: set `CSC_LINK` (base64 .pfx) + `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD` as CI secrets.
- macOS: set `CSC_LINK`/`CSC_KEY_PASSWORD` (Developer ID) + `APPLE_ID` + `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD` + `APPLE_TEAM_ID`. Flip `notarize: false → true` in `electron-builder.yml`. Notarization then runs automatically.

All env-var driven — **no code changes** to turn signing on.

## 6. Cutting a release

### Via CI (recommended — builds all 3 OSes)
```bash
npm version patch                       # bumps package.json, commits, tags vX.Y.Z
git push <remote> <branch> --follow-tags
```
The pushed tag triggers `release.yml`. CI uses the auto-provided `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` — **no PAT needed**. Watch: `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/actions`.

### Locally (Windows only, from a Windows PC)
```powershell
$env:GH_TOKEN="<your classic PAT with repo scope>"
npm run dist:win -- --publish always
```
Produces `release/*.exe` + `latest.yml` and uploads to the GitHub Release. Mac/Linux **cannot** be built this way on Windows.

> ⚠️ Never paste a token into chat, a commit, or a file. Set it as an env var in your own shell. Revoke any token that leaks, even short-lived ones.

---

## 7. Testing auto-update end-to-end

An update only fires when the **installed app is older than the newest release**. So you need **two** releases.

1. **Publish + install the "old" version** (e.g. 0.1.2). Install the `.exe`.
2. **Publish a newer version:**
   ```powershell
   npm version patch                     # 0.1.2 -> 0.1.3, commit + tag
   git push <remote> <branch> --follow-tags
   ```
3. **Launch the installed 0.1.2.** On startup it checks the feed, silently downloads 0.1.3, installs on quit. **Close + reopen → 0.1.3.**

### Verify it worked — 3 ways
1. **Log file (definitive):**
   ```powershell
   Get-Content "$env:APPDATA\Photo Editor\logs\main.log" -Wait -Tail 20
   ```
   Look for: `checking` → `update-available {"version":"0.1.3"}` → `update-downloaded {"version":"0.1.3"}`.
2. **Version after restart** — the app reports `app.getVersion()` (exposed via `window.desktop.getInfo()`), flips 0.1.2 → 0.1.3.
3. **Windows Settings → Apps → "Photo Editor"** — version changes after install-on-quit.

### Critical gotchas
- The updater is guarded by **`app.isPackaged`** — it only runs in the **installed** app, never `npm run electron:dev`.
- Log path uses `productName`: `%APPDATA%\Photo Editor\logs\main.log`.
- macOS: the banner test needs only a newer release tag; no signing required to see the banner.

## 8. Testing on your own GitHub account (the fork story)

Because you're only a contributor on the `codnix-github` repo, test releases go to a **personal repo** (`Mihirprajapati563/printpoz-update-test`). Make it **PUBLIC** — electron-updater downloads release assets directly, and private-repo assets need an auth token (complicates the test).

**Getting the code there was blocked by GitHub push protection** (secrets in history — see §9). The workaround that avoids history-scrubbing tools (BFG/filter-repo) is an **orphan branch** = one fresh commit of the cleaned working tree, no history:

```powershell
git remote add myfork https://github.com/Mihirprajapati563/printpoz-update-test.git
git checkout --orphan clean-test
git add -A
git add -f package-lock.json         # gitignored, but CI's `npm ci` needs it
git commit -m "Test distribution build (clean tree, no secret history)"
git push myfork clean-test:main -f
git tag v0.1.2
git push myfork v0.1.2               # triggers CI
```

Your `develop` branch stays untouched; all test config (hardcoded owner/repo, removed secrets) lives on `clean-test`.

### First-run CI snags
- **Release step 403** → Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions → **"Read and write permissions"** → Save, re-run.
- **Actions didn't run** → Settings → Actions → General → **"Allow all actions"**.

---

## 9. Secret handling (IMPORTANT — security debt)

GitHub push protection blocked the first push because **live secrets are in the git history** of the codnix repo. These are the exact ones flagged in [`.claude/rules/security.md`](../.claude/rules/security.md):

| Secret | File | Status in `clean-test` |
|---|---|---|
| Google OAuth Client ID + **Client Secret** | `src/tools/photos/googlePhotosPickerUtils.js` (config + dead commented block, lines ~8-9 & ~70-73) | **Removed** from working tree |
| **OpenAI API Key** | `src/tools/text/CaptionByAI.jsx:58` | **Removed** from working tree |
| Example secret in docs | `docs/ISSUES.md:30` | **Redacted** |

**Rules learned:**
- Removing a secret from a file **today** does NOT remove it from **past commits** — pushing a branch pushes all history. The orphan branch sidesteps this (no history).
- **Commenting out** a secret line does not hide it — the scanner still flags it. Delete the line.
- The `block-secrets` PreToolUse hook blocks *edits whose payload contains a secret*, even edits that REMOVE it. Work around by deleting lines by number (`sed -i '70,75d'`) — the secret value never enters the command.
- **Never click the "unblock-secret" URLs** to force-push into a public repo — that publishes working credentials to be scraped within minutes.

### ⚠️ Still outstanding (do regardless of this testing)
The secrets are **still live in the `codnix-github` origin history** and on GitHub. They must be:
1. **Deleted from the code** (route Google Photos via a **PKCE desktop client**, captions via the **backend**).
2. **Rotated** (the OAuth Client Secret + OpenAI key — assume compromised).
3. Flagged to whoever owns the codnix repo.

## 10. Known issues

### macOS build failed — exit 134 = React build ran OUT OF MEMORY (not signing!)
The exit 134 (SIGABRT) on the mac runner was a **JavaScript heap OOM** in the CRA production build, NOT a codesign problem:
```
FATAL ERROR: Reached heap limit Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory
sh: line 1: 1844 Abort trap: 6   npm run build
```
The build peaked at Node's ~2 GB default old-space heap and aborted. Windows/Linux runners had enough RAM to squeak by; the Apple-Silicon mac runner (less RAM) didn't. `identity: null` was a red herring — the DMG/codesign step is never reached.

**Fix (applied):** set `NODE_OPTIONS: --max-old-space-size=4096` on the build step in `release.yml`. Raise to 6144 if it ever recurs. (`identity: null` is kept — it's still the correct setting for an unsigned mac build, just wasn't the cause here.)

### Auto-update "never downloaded anything" — releases were DRAFTS
The installed app's badge showed **"Update check failed"** and nothing ever downloaded. Root cause: **electron-builder publishes GitHub releases as `draft` by default**, and **electron-updater cannot read draft releases** (their assets aren't publicly served → `latest.yml` 404s → check errors → no download). This is the #1 silent-auto-update gotcha.

**Fix (applied):** `releaseType: release` under `publish:` in `electron-builder.yml` — releases publish immediately so the feed is live. **Also delete the old draft releases** (0.1.2–0.1.4) from the Releases page so they don't linger.

### Node 20 deprecation warning
`actions/checkout@v4` / `actions/setup-node@v4` "target Node 20 but forced to run on Node 24." **Harmless warning, NOT an error** — GitHub auto-runs the actions on Node 24 and they work fine. No fix needed; newer action majors will target Node 24 eventually.

## 11. Future / when to revisit

- **R2 / S3 hosting:** only if GitHub bandwidth becomes a cost problem (tens of thousands of users). Migration = change `provider: github` → `provider: s3` + endpoint in `electron-builder.yml`. Not before.
- **Delta updates:** already emitted (`.blockmap`) — electron-updater downloads only changed chunks automatically.
- **Windows signing:** buy a cert when going public to kill the SmartScreen warning.
- **macOS signing:** Apple Developer account → then delete the notify-banner path and let mac update silently.
- **Move token storage to `secureStore`** (planned renderer hardening) — unrelated to distribution but on the security list.
